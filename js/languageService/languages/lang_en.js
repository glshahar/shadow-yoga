This chapter, entitled ‘Yoga of the Shadow Man’, deals with the intricate manifestations of the shadow and their significance both inside and outside the human organism. The Ashtanga Hrdaya of Vagbhata, a primary ayurvedic text, also contains a chapter on the shadow which deals with diagnostic principles. There is also a story about Allama Prabhudeva, the initiating guru of Gorakshanath (one of the famous forefathers of Hatha Yoga), in which he describes the human body as nothing but layers of frozen shadows. According to Hatha Yogic anatomy the body is composed of three discrete bodies and five sheaths (coverings or shadows). The practice of Hatha Yoga has evolved with the purpose of dissolving these shadows.",

In 2007, I met my uncle, Malka, and since then I have been practicing Yoga. A few years later, I started to study with Sandor Ramata, a master of the shadow yoga school and Emma Blanves. I feel fortunate that I have persisted in yoga, and am thrilled by the many layers in which it deepens. I am grateful to the teachers who lead me safely, and I am happy to have the right to help others walk this wonderful way.",
